## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Solana wallet (e.g., [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [Backpack](https://backpack.app/), or [Solflare](https://solflare.com/)).
- Some SOL in your wallet to pay for transaction fees (though execution fees are taken from the trade).

## Step 1: Connect to Cloak

Navigate to [app.cloak.trade](https://app.cloak.trade) and click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top right corner.

Select your wallet provider from the list and approve the connection request.

## Step 2: Choose an Execution Mode

Cloak offers different modes depending on your needs:

- **Instant**: For immediate execution with privacy.
- **Stealth**: For large orders that need to be split over time.
- **Limit**: For setting a specific price target.

<Tip>
  Use **Stealth Mode** if you are moving a large amount and want to avoid slippage or front-running.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Execute a Swap

1. Select the token you want to **Sell** and the token you want to **Buy**.
2. Enter the amount to trade.
3. Adjust **Slippage** and **Priority Fees** in the settings if needed.
4. Click **Swap**.

### Signing the Intent

Unlike a normal swap, you will be asked to **sign an intent**, not a transaction. This signature authorizes Cloak's executor network to perform the trade on your behalf according to your specified parameters.

<Warning>
  You are **not** sending funds to a contract (unless using Stealth Sell). You are signing a message that allows the trade to happen atomically.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Track Your Trade

Once signed, your order will appear in the **Orders** tab or **History** tab.

- **Status**: You can see if your trade is `Queued`, `Executing`, or `Settled`.
- **Details**: Click on a trade to view the specific chunks and execution timestamps.
