## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Solana-compatible wallet (e.g., [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [Backpack](https://backpack.app/), or [Solflare](https://solflare.com/)).
- Sufficient SOL for transaction fees (execution fees are deducted from the trade).

## Step 1: Connect to CLOAK

Navigate to [app.cloak.trade](https://app.cloak.trade) and select **Connect Wallet** in the top-right corner.

</Frame>

Choose your wallet provider and approve the connection request.

## Step 2: Choose an Execution Mode

CLOAK provides distinct execution modes:

- **Instant**: Single-step execution with intent-based privacy.
- **Stealth**: Large orders fragmented and executed over a configurable duration.
- **Limit**: Execution conditional on a specified price level.

<Tip>
  Use **Stealth Mode** for large order sizes to reduce slippage and front-running risk.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Execute a Swap

1. Select the **Sell** and **Buy** tokens.
2. Enter the trade amount.
3. Optionally adjust **Slippage** and **Priority Fees** in settings.
4. Select **Swap**.

### Signing the Intent

Execution is authorized via an **intent signature**, not a direct transaction signature. This signature authorizes the executor network to perform the trade on your behalf according to the specified parameters.

<Warning>
  You are **not** transferring funds to a contract (except in Stealth Sell flows). You are signing a message that enables atomic execution by the executor.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Track Your Trade

After signing, the order appears under **Orders** or **History**.

- **Status**: `Queued`, `Executing`, or `Settled`.
- **Details**: Select a trade to view chunk-level execution and timestamps.
