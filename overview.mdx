## High-Level Overview

Cloak Trade is built on a modular architecture designed to separate user intent from on-chain execution. This separation is key to our privacy model.

The system consists of three main components:

1. **User Client (Web App)**: Where you connect your wallet and sign intents.
2. **Relay & Orchestrator**: The backend services that process intents and manage execution.
3. **Executor Network**: A distributed set of hot wallets that submit transactions to the blockchain.

## Key Components

### 1. Relay Layer
The Relay is a stateless service that receives encrypted intents from the client. It performs basic validation and rate-limiting before forwarding the encrypted payload to the Orchestrator. The Relay does not hold keys to decrypt the intent.

### 2. Orchestrator
The core of the system. The Orchestrator:
- Verifies your signature.
- Decrypts the intent.
- Plans the execution (e.g., scheduling chunks for Stealth Mode).
- Selects an optimal Executor Wallet.
- Monitors the blockchain for settlement.

### 3. Executor Wallets
These are hot wallets funded and managed by Cloak. They are responsible for submitting the actual swap transactions to Solana. Because they are distinct from your user wallet, they break the direct link between your address and the swap.

### 4. Escrow Program
For Stealth Sells, assets are deposited into a non-custodial Anchor program. This ensures that your funds are safe and can only be withdrawn by an authorized executor with a proof of your Signed Intent, or returned to you upon cancellation.
