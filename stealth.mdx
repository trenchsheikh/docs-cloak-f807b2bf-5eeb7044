description: "Split large orders to minimize impact and tracking"

## Overview

Stealth Execution (Stealth Buy/Sell) is intended for larger order sizes. Instead of a single execution, CLOAK fragments the order into multiple randomized execution chunks and executes them over a configurable time window.

## Configuration

In Stealth Mode you can configure:

- **Duration**: Execution window (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes).
- **Intensity**:
  - **Low**: 3–5 chunks, longer inter-chunk delays (15–40s).
  - **Medium**: 5–9 chunks, medium delays (10–30s).
  - **High**: 8–15 chunks, shorter delays (5–25s).

## Mechanics

1. **Randomization**: Chunk size and inter-chunk delay are randomized within configured bounds.
2. **Executor Rotation**: Chunks may be executed by different Executor Wallets to further obfuscate the execution pattern.
3. **Escrow (Sells)**: For Stealth Sells, tokens are deposited into a non-custodial escrow program. Withdrawals occur only upon orchestrator-verified intent; user funds remain protected.

## Use Cases

- **Accumulation**: Build a position with reduced market impact and attribution.
- **Exit**: Unwind a large position with reduced price impact and reduced disclosure of total size.

## Fees

- **Service Fee**: 20–30 bps (0.20% - 0.30%)
