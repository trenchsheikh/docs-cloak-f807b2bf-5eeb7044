## Overview

CLOAK enables execution of swap operations on Solana while decoupling wallet identity from on-chain execution and strategy disclosure. The protocol uses a distributed executor network and orchestration layer to obfuscate transaction attribution and mitigate MEV exposure.

    Single-step execution. The client signs an intent; executor nodes submit the on-chain transaction.

    Large orders are fragmented into randomized execution chunks over a configurable time window to reduce market impact and attribution.

## How it Works

CLOAK decouples **intent** (declared trade parameters) from **execution** (on-chain transaction submission).
