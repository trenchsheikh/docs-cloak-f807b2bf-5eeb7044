## Threat Model

Cloak is designed to protect against specific threats inherent to public blockchains:
- **Wallet Linkability**: Preventing observers from easily linking a swap to your main wallet.
- **Strategy Inference**: Making it difficult to guess your overall position or strategy based on a single transaction.
- **MEV/Sandwich Attacks**: Reducing the risk of predatory trading bots by using private executors.

## What we DO protect against

- **Basic Linkage**: Your wallet never signs the swap transaction.
- **Clustering**: Repeated trades from the same wallet are harder to correlate.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Chunking and randomization make large orders look like unrelated market noise.

## What we do NOT protect against

- **Nation-State Adversaries**: Advanced traffic analysis (IP/timing correlation) is out of scope.
- **Fund Flows**: If you withdraw from a KYC'd exchange directly to a fresh wallet and then use Cloak, the flow of funds is still traceable on-chain.

## Safety Principles

1. **No Loss of Funds**: In the event of a system failure, your funds should always be recoverable.
2. **Non-Custodial**: We do not hold your private keys or pool your funds (except in the specific case of the Escrow for Stealth Sells).
