## Threat Model

CLOAK is designed to mitigate specific threats of public blockchains:

- **Wallet Linkability**: Reducing the ability of observers to associate a swap with a specific wallet.
- **Strategy Inference**: Making it difficult to infer position or strategy from individual transactions.
- **MEV/Sandwich Attacks**: Reducing exposure to predatory bots by using dedicated executors for execution.

## What we DO protect against

- **Direct Linkage**: The user wallet never signs the swap transaction.
- **Clustering**: Repeated execution from the same wallet is harder to correlate on-chain.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Chunking and randomization make large orders resemble unrelated market activity.

## What we do NOT protect against

- **Nation-State Adversaries**: Advanced traffic analysis (IP/timing correlation) is out of scope.
- **Fund Flows**: If you move funds from a KYC exchange to a fresh wallet and then use CLOAK, the flow remains traceable on-chain.

## Safety Principles

1. **No Loss of Funds**: In case of system failure, user funds remain recoverable.
2. **Non-Custodial**: We do not hold user private keys or pool user funds (except for the Stealth Sell escrow).
