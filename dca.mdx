## Overview

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. Cloak's Private DCA automates this process while incorporating privacy-enhancing techniques.

## Configuration

You can customize your DCA schedule:
- **Interval**: Frequency of buys (e.g., daily, weekly).
- **Number of Occurrences**: How many times the buy should execute.
- **Execution Style**:
  - **Instant**: Executed immediately at the scheduled time.
  - **Stealth**: Executed with randomized delays around the scheduled time to avoid detection.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Market Impact**: Scheduled buys are executed privately, preventing front-running.
- **Privacy**: Consistent buying patterns are masked by the separation of intent and execution.

## Fees

- **Service Fee**: 25–40 bps (0.25% - 0.40%) per execution.
