## Overview

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a strategy of executing fixed-notional buys at regular intervals. CLOAK’s Private DCA automates this while applying privacy-preserving execution (intent/execution separation and optional stealth).

## Configuration

DCA schedule parameters:

- **Interval**: Execution frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).
- **Number of Occurrences**: Total number of scheduled executions.
- **Execution Style**:
  - **Instant**: Executed at the scheduled time.
  - **Stealth**: Executed with randomized delay around the scheduled time to reduce pattern visibility.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Market Impact**: Scheduled buys are executed through the executor network, reducing front-running.
- **Privacy**: Regular buying patterns are obscured by intent/execution separation.

## Fees

- **Service Fee**: 25–40 bps (0.25% - 0.40%) per execution.
