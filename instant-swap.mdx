## Overview

Instant Private Swap is the fastest way to trade on Cloak. It allows you to execute a swap immediately while breaking the on-chain link between your wallet and the execution.

## How it Works

1. **Sign Intent**: You sign an intent off-chain that specifies the input token, output token, and minimum amount out.
2. **Orchestrator Processing**: Our orchestrator verifies your signature and selects an available Executor Wallet.
3. **Execution**: The Executor Wallet submits the swap transaction to the Solana blockchain.
4. **Settlement**: The output tokens are sent to your specified destination address.

## Benefits

- **Privacy**: Your wallet does not send the swap transaction.
- **MEV Protection**: Since the transaction is submitted by our private executors, it is harder for MEV bots to front-run your specific wallet.

## Fees

- **Service Fee**: 10–15 bps (0.10% - 0.15%)
- **Network Fee**: Standard Solana transaction fees (paid by the executor and covered by the service fee).
