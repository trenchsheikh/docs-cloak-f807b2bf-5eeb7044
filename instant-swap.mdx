## Overview

Instant Swap provides single-step execution on CLOAK. It executes a swap in one step while breaking the on-chain link between the user wallet and the execution transaction.

## How it Works

1. **Intent Signing**: The client signs an off-chain intent specifying input token, output token, and minimum amount out.
2. **Orchestrator Processing**: The orchestrator verifies the signature and assigns an available Executor Wallet.
3. **Execution**: The Executor Wallet submits the swap transaction to the Solana blockchain.
4. **Settlement**: Output tokens are transferred to the specified destination address.

## Benefits

- **Privacy**: The user wallet does not submit the swap transaction.
- **MEV Mitigation**: Execution is submitted by dedicated executors, reducing the ability of MEV bots to front-run the user wallet.

## Fees

- **Service Fee**: 10–15 bps (0.10% - 0.15%)
- **Network Fee**: Standard Solana transaction fees (borne by the executor and included in the service fee).
