## Overview

Private Limit Orders allow you to set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell. Unlike standard limit orders on a DEX, Cloak's limit orders are **not visible** on the public order book.

## How it Works

1. **Intent Creation**: You specify the `limit_price` in your intent.
2. **Monitoring**: The Cloak Orchestrator monitors the market price off-chain.
3. **Trigger**: When the market price matches your limit price (incorporating fees and slippage), the Orchestrator triggers the execution.
4. **Execution**: The trade is executed using the standard Instant or Stealth mechanics, depending on your preference.

## Privacy Advantage

Since your order is not on-chain until it executes, other market participants cannot see your buy/sell walls. This prevents:
- **Front-running**: Bots cannot place orders just ahead of yours.
- **Price Manipulation**: The market cannot react to your pending liquidity.

## Fees

- **Service Fee**: 25–40 bps (0.25% - 0.40%)
