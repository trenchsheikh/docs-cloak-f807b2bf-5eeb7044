## Overview

Private Limit Orders allow specification of a price level for buy or sell execution. Unlike public DEX limit orders, CLOAK limit orders are **not** exposed on the public order book.

## How it Works

1. **Intent Creation**: The client specifies `limit_price` in the intent.
2. **Monitoring**: The CLOAK Orchestrator monitors market price off-chain.
3. **Trigger**: When market price satisfies the limit condition (accounting for fees and slippage), the Orchestrator triggers execution.
4. **Execution**: The trade is executed using Instant or Stealth mechanics according to configuration.

## Privacy Advantage

Because the order is not on-chain until execution, other participants cannot observe your limit level. This mitigates:
- **Front-running**: Bots cannot position ahead of your order.
- **Information leakage**: The market cannot react to your pending liquidity.

## Fees

- **Service Fee**: 25–40 bps (0.25% - 0.40%)
