## Overview

CLOAK enables execution of swap operations on Solana while decoupling wallet identity from on-chain execution and strategy disclosure. The protocol uses a distributed executor network and orchestration layer to obfuscate transaction attribution and mitigate MEV exposure.

## Core Features

Preserve execution alpha through configurable execution modes.

  <Card title="Instant Swap" icon="bolt" href="/features/instant-swap">
    Single-step execution. The client signs an intent; executor nodes submit the on-chain transaction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stealth Execution" icon="user-secret" href="/features/stealth">
    Large orders are fragmented into randomized execution chunks over a configurable time window to reduce market impact and attribution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Private Limit Orders" icon="chart-line" href="/features/limit-orders">
    Submit limit orders that remain off the public order book until execution is triggered.

    Automate dollar-cost averaging schedules without exposing a deterministic on-chain execution pattern.

## How it Works

CLOAK decouples **intent** (declared trade parameters) from **execution** (on-chain transaction submission).

## Safety First

  CLOAK is not a mixer. User funds are not pooled. Custody remains with the user until execution settlement.
