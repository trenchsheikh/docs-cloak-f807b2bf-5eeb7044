## Philosophy

CLOAK is non-custodial: privacy-preserving execution does not require entrusting a third party with custody of funds.

## How it applies

### Instant Swaps & Stealth Buys

In these modes, the Executor Wallet sources the input token (SOL or USDC) from its own inventory. The user effectively pays the executor atomically. **User funds do not leave the wallet until the swap is executed and output tokens are delivered.**

### Stealth Sells (The Escrow Exception)

Stealth Sells require depositing the sell-side token into a smart contract (Escrow). The contract is **trust-minimized**:

- **Immutable Logic**: Contract behavior is fixed and verifiable on-chain.
- **Restricted Withdrawal**: Only an executor with a valid signed proof from the user can withdraw chunks for execution.
- **User Control**: The user can cancel and withdraw remaining funds from escrow at any time (subject to cancellation policy).

## No Pooling

Unlike mixers, CLOAK does not pool user funds. Each execution is independent. This simplifies the regulatory profile and reduces the risk of clean funds being associated with other actors’ flows.
